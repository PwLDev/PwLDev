## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm PwL, or most commonly known as PwLDev. I'm a Mexican student and hobby developer in my free time.
I speak 3 languages: Spanish, English and French

### âœ¨ What I like to do? 

Coding is my passion. I like writing my own programs and libraries and I always learn something new while doing that.
I also watch movies, anime, create videogames and make 3D modeling and animations.

### ðŸŒ± What Iâ€™m currently learning

I'm currently learning Chinese language and world history.

### âš¡ Fun facts

- I'm not very good at math.
- The first time I learned some concepts of coding was when I copied a Discord bot code from a Youtube tutorial.
- "Purriau" is my favorite word, a Spanish word that I invented mixing "purr" and "miau".
